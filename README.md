  Here you can find instructions to set up the PyPokerEnvironment and how to play around with it.

## Brainstormy To-Do / To-Try list
   Add anything that comes to your mind.
   
   - Try the bot with networks 
      - Try different networks (recurrent i.e.) 
      
   - Try the bot with formulas 
   - Experiment with different optimization functions 
     - i.e. how many chips after a game of 1000 hands? 
     - Expected Value of actions taken (approach outlined in the proposal
