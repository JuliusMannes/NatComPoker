# NatComPoker
  Final Project of the course Natural Computing - an evolutionary Pokerbot

## Hello, dear teacher! 
  This is our repository containing the code for the project. 
  In the code section there are a lot of different .py files, most of which you can ignore, as they are part of the PyPokerEngine. Most of the code from that engine is not changed by us. 
  The 'interesting' pieces of code, or files that we created are all to be found in the /poker/code directory (immediatly     there, so not in the /poker/code/PyPokerEngine directory. We have changed only a few lines in the engine's code to make it   working with our implementation. 
  
  When you execute the main.py file, you will execute our third experiment. Be aware that one experiment can take easily up   to 52 hours, so I advice you to quit it once you have seen enough. The game loop, or what you will be seeing on the         terminal output is described in our report. 
  
  I hope it is not too messy in here...

## Brainstormy To-Do / To-Try list
   Add anything that comes to your mind.
   
   - Try the bot with networks 
      - Try different networks (recurrent i.e.) 
      
   - Try the bot with formulas 
   - Experiment with different optimization functions 
     - i.e. how many chips after a game of 1000 hands? 
     - Expected Value of actions taken (approach outlined in the proposal
